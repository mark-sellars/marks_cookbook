How to make the perfect steak
=============================
- I typically make this with a cast iron pan

Ingredients
===========
- Steak, preferably a thick cut, ribeye is my favorite 
- Kosher / Sea Salt to taste
- Corse Pepper to taste
- Olive or avacado oil
- 1/2 to 1 tbsp of butter per steak
- 1 sheet of tin foil per steak to wrap

Directions
==========
1. Preheat the oven to 350 - 400
2. Coat the steaks in oil, add salt and pepper. (Do not use anything else, you will ruin your steak you mutant!)
3. Heat up a pan as hot as you can get it, drip water on to the pan, the water should evaporate between 1 and 2 seconds.
4. Drop your steak in the middle of the pan, or place your steaks evenly in the pan. (Do NOT move them)
5. After 2 minutes flip the steak/s, dont screw around with them. 
6. After another 2 minutes place a pice of butter on the steaks and put in the oven.
7. At 125 degrees take the steaks out and imediatly wrap in tin foil for 5 minutes.
8. After 5 minutes unwrap your steak and eat it. Dont screw up my steaks with sauce or anything, they are perfect!
